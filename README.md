# VERO - Very - Efficient - Report - Organizer 

DOWNLOAD: 

For windows systems, please download the EXE avaliable under the "releases" tab to the right.


Purpose:
	VERO is a quick and easy way to match the Sales Item file and Cart Cancelled file against each other. It will compare every row based on time. If an item appears within three minutes of each other on BOTH reports, It will automatically remove those rows. Those rows can be assumed to be an accidental cancellation of an item that was likely purchased in the following minute or so and can be skipped. 

 
However, the option to keep these rows, but mark them with “======” in the product name, is available if the user would like to still review them. The program also allows the ability to modify the times in both reports if the location under review has a time difference that should be added or subtracted from the reports. It will also automatically remove unwanted rows and organize the reports from most to least recent transactions. 


The program will also take in account for locations that have multiple kiosks. If multiple kiosks are present and the option is selected, the program will then compare the kiosk serial numbers between the rows that are flagged for removal. If the kiosks match, it can be assumed that the item is an accidental cancellation and can be removed. However, if the kiosks do NOT match, the program will flag those products with ******* (asterisks). These rows could be assumed to be an individual who has walked to a different kiosk, with the cancelled item, to finish the transaction there. There is still uncertainty that there were two people who just happened to have the same items and one individual has canceled their order and left with the item in hand. So such rows should still be treated with some doubt, however the option to remove these rows is available if the user wishes. 


Finally, the program has the option to either delete the original files that are used or keep them. The program will ALWAYS print two new reports that are sorted, thus the third file option “Output Folder” which does NOT exist automatically and the program will NOT make an automatic output folder. Please make your own folder for selection for the program to use as output.
